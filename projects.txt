// This is a comment
// A comment takes all the line so you cant write in-line comments
// You can add new projects in the form of:
// project_name: hours_worked
// If you haven't worked in the project yet
// put a zero so the program doesn't break.

// Examples:
FacebookWorkPoster: 1
started_project: 12
